Living Room Renovation – Budget Smart Upgrade

The original space showed major wall cracks (score 0.72), peeling paint (0.64), moisture-stained ceiling, and uneven lighting. RenovAI prioritized structural repair and surface restoration first.

With a ₹100,000 budget, the system optimized the plan to include crack repair, waterproof repainting, and LED lighting upgrades while deferring flooring replacement to stay within limits.

The result is a smooth, crack-free finish, durable fresh paint, brighter balanced lighting, and a visibly modernized living space — all achieved through AI-driven cost and priority optimization.
